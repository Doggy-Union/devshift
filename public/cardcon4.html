						<td>Hacking the FBI: How & Why to Liberate Government Records</td>
						<td>The records of government are the property of the people, but these records are consistently withheld from us. My talk will cover my research into the historical and contemporary use of the rhetoric and apparatus of national security to marginalize political dissent, my work to reveal the hidden mechanisms of FBI FOIA operations, the FBI’s efforts to shut down my research, the ongoing crisis of secrecy and consequent threat to democracy, and the pressing need for additional modes of hacking the FBI and other intelligence agencies to pick up where FOIA leaves off. </td>

						<td>Bob Pan</td>
						<td>"APK File Infection on an Android System"</td>
						<td>This concept of APK file infection on Android is similar to the concept of PE file infection on Windows systems. As the performance of Android device has increased, it's become possible to implement such a concept in Android systems. We will demonstrate how to implement this concept. In addition, we will also give a demo to show that a PoC virus can infect normal APK files in a real Android mobile phone.</td>

						<td>Weaponizing nanotechnology and hacking humans – defining the boundaries</td>
						<td>The barrier between humans and computers has been pushed for many years, however we’ve now crossed into territory that goes beyond embedded technology, chip placement or prosthetics. We are at a point in evolution where our living breathing bodies directly interact with the very systems we design through the revolution in nanotechnology development, we are simply going to hack the human. </td>

						<td>SE145</td>
						<td>Kevin Johnson</td>
						<td>Securing our Ethics: Ethics and Privacy in a Target-Rich Environment</td>
						<td>Security has become a huge conversation, especially when you consider privacy as part of it. In this presentation, Kevin Johnson of Secure Ideas will explore the topics of ethics and how they play in a security mindset. We will explore topics such as bug bounties, when its ok to test an application without permission and licensing of penetration testers and security researchers. </td>

						<td>Chad Dewey</td>
						<td>Knock your dox off</td>
						<td>The information age is upon us. We live in an age where knowledge is at our fingertips, should we choose to pursue it. Businesses, government entities, hackers, crackers, and everyone in between has data stored somewhere about all of us whether we’re aware of it or not. In this presentation, we're going to learn a bit about "doxing", which is simply digging up information on the internet, or using algorithms that are already in place, to learn how certain pieces of information are not entirely bulletproof against discovery.</td>

					<tr>
						<td>12:00pm</td>
						<td>SE145</td>
						<td>Jack Daniel</td>
						<td>Better living through chemistry: a hackers guide to home bartending</td>
						<td>This class is an introduction to making drinks, and making drinks better. The course will begin with a cocktail history, followed by review of several relevant books, and then move into a discussion of ingredients- including bitters, liquors, sweeteners, juices and syrup. Tools and glassware will be covered, what you need to start, and what you don't need. The class will close with making some classic cocktails and a few variants on the classics. There will be a charge for this class to cover the cost of alcohol. You must be 21 to take the class.</td>

						<td>Brent White</td>
						<td>From parking lot to pwnage – hack-free network pwnage</td>
						<td>Pretending to be an employee is one thing, but owning layers of identities is what leads to owning the data center. In this presentation you will listen to real world scenarios that led to armed guards opening the server room for the "employee" to Secretaries handing over an Executive's laptop. All of this and more, from parking lot to pwnage.</td>

						<td>Burner Phone DDOS 2 dollars a day : 70 Calls a Minute</td>
						<td>Phone DDOS research. Current proof of concept is dealing with Samsung SCH-U365 QUALCOMM prepaid Verizon phone custom firmware was written that makes it into an anonymous DOS systems It Does PRL list hopping and several other interesting evasion methods. The new firmware allows two features one, you text it a number and it will spam call that number 70 times a min. till battery dies. All for 2 dollars a day. And second feature is that if a number that is in address book calls it, automatically picks up on speaker phone. Also ways to mitigate this attack with load balancing Call manager and Captcha based systems.</td>

						<td>Adam Brand</td>
						<td>Medical devices: pwnage and honeypots</td>
						<td>We know medical devices are exposed to the Internet both directly and indirectly, so just how hard is it to take it to the next step in an attack and gain remote administrative access to these critical life saving devices?  We will discuss over 20 CVEís Scott has reported over the last year that will demonstrate how an attacker can gain remote administrative access to medical devices and supporting systems. Over 100 remote service and support credentials for medical devices will be presented. So is an attack against medical devices a reality or just a myth?  Now that we know these devices have Internet facing exposure and are vulnerable to exploit, are they being targeted?  We will release and present six months of medical device honeypot research showing the implications of these patient care devices increasing their connectivity.</td>

						<td>Chris Roberts</td>
						<td>Security hopscotch</td>
						<td>As humans we move between the various electronic domains within our lives. We are familiar with those on our desks and in our pockets.  We have been made aware of the ones in the transportation we use and the interactions with the world around us, but now we’re moving into the “Age Of Everything”. And we are vulnerable. This session will discuss those vulnerabilities and some solutions.</td>

						<td>3:00pm</td>
						<td>SE137</td>
						<td>Panel</td>
						<td>We have met the future of security and it is us</td>
						<td>Security is increasingly becoming more embedded in operations and development. InfoSec professionals will become more specialized, either at a technical level or they will become liaisons between various groups ensuring that security is consistent across the organization. This panel will cover this important shift and what it means to the future of security.</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td>3:00pm</td>
						<td>SE145</td>
						<td>Panel</td>
						<td>Licensed to pwn</td>
						<td>Security research is under attack. Updates to the Wassenaar Arrangement in 2013 established among its 41 member nations an agreement to place a variety of previously undesignated “cybersecurity items” under export control. After 18 months and a half-dozen open advisory meetings, the U.S. has taken the entire security research community by surprise with its proposed rule; we are confronted by a sweeping implementation with profound consequences for academia, independent research, commercial cybersecurity, human rights, and national security. While the outcome of this round of regulatory intervention is still uncertain, the fact that there will be more is not. This panel of experts will discuss the context, history, and general process of regulation, as well the related question of “weaponized” research in regulatory discourse.</td>

					<tr>
						<td>4:00pm</td>
						<td>SE137</td>
						<td>Richard Thieme</td>
						<td>Playing through the pain – the impact of secrets and dark knowledge on security and intelligence professionals</td>
						<td>Dismissing or laughing off concerns about what it does to a person to know critical secrets does not lessen the impact when those secrets build a different map of reality than "normals" use and one has to calibrate narratives to what another believes. The cognitive dissonance that inevitably causes is managed by some with denial who live as if refusing to feel the pain makes it disappear. But as Philip K. Dick said, reality is that which, when you no longer believe in it, refuses to go away. And when cognitive dissonance evolves into symptoms of traumatic stress, one ignores those symptoms at one's peril. But the constraints of one's work often make it impossible to speak aloud about those symptoms, because that might threaten one's clearances, work, and career. The real cost of security work and professional intelligence goes beyond dollars. It is measured in family life, relationships, and mental and physical well-being. </td>

					<tr>
						<td>4:00pm</td>
						<td>SE145</td>
						<td>Christopher Soghoian </td>
						<td>Blinding The Surveillance State</td>
						<td>We live in a surveillance state. Law enforcement and intelligence agencies have access to a huge amount of data about us, enabling them to learn intimate, private details about our lives. In part, the ease with which they can obtain such information reflects the fact that our laws have failed to keep up with advances in technology. However, privacy enhancing technologies can offer real protections even when the law does not. That intelligence agencies like the NSA are able to collect records about every telephone call made in the United States, or engage in the bulk surveillance of Internet communications is only possible because so much of our data is transmitted in the clear. The privacy enhancing technologies required to make bulk surveillance impossible and targeted surveillance more difficult already exist. We just need to start using them.</td>
